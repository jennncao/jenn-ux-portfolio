                <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Background</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was created during my time at the University of Pittsburgh as a team project to study the design of an existing application and to propose a redesign of said application to provide
                    a positive impact on the targeted user base.
                </p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Many people typically use the Goodreads website to find recommendations for new books to read. However, upon navigating the site, it can become confusing and overwhelming in certain sections and pages to find what one is looking for.
                    Because of the sheer volume of books that exist, it is difficult to find an easily navigatable solution to aid an average individual's book search. Thus, it can be confusing to locate and decide what book to read next. 
                </p>
                <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    Design a lo-fi prototype in Figma that add elements to the existing Goodreads website that encourages a more interactive experience with the site and makes the new book search easier.
                    Users will be able to more easily find new book recommendations as well as being able to easily find people to interact with based on similar interests.
                </p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Research</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Demographics</h2>
            <p>
                <a style="font-weight: 700;">45%</a> of Goodreads users access the application through a PC.
                <br>
                <br>
                Women are <a style="font-weight: 700;">40%</a> more likely to be active on the site.
                <br>
                <br>
                The largest age group to visit the site is between ages <a style="font-weight: 700;">18 and 34.</a>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Site Navigation</h2>
            <p>
                Interaction alongside three other users with the site before the redesign found certain hindrances to the book search including:
                <br>
                <div class = "columns">
                    <div class = "line">Searching for a book in the fantasy genre.</div>
                    <div class = "line">Composing a message to a friend. </div>
                    <div class = "line">Liking a friend's post.</div>
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                Results from site navigation found that users had slight trouble locating the correct page to search for a fantasy novel: directly trying to search the term "fantasy" in the search bar
                and hovering over the left-most column under the "Browse" tab before finding the genre search page. All participants had difficulty navigating the through the friend's profile to find a "message" button.
                Users also noted that the text within the messages tab itself was small, resulting in slower reaction time to locate the button to compose a message. Something to note is that when asked where they 
                typically found book recommendations, users most responded that they got recommendations from others such as friends or book social media influencers.
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">User Persona</h2>
            <p>
                By combining demographic research with initial user testing results, I was able to create a persona to represent a targeted user group.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container">
                    <img src="images/persona.png" alt="User Persona">
                </div>
                </p>
            </section>
        <section>
            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Ideation</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Storyboard</h2>
            <p>
                After creating the persona, I was able to place her in a situation where she can use the redesigned product. This specific storyboard 
                allows Tasha to use a "favorite books" feature on the redesigned prototype to get potential book recommendations from someone who has similar tastes.
                Since other viewers will be able to view one person's favorite books directly on their profile, they will be able to request to add them as a friend or start a charsetwith them because of similar interest, enabling meeting more people and facilitating conversation.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container">
                    <img src="images/storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard">
                </div>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">User Flow Sketches</h2>
            <p>
                Sketches were drawn to help figure out user flow paths for certain tasks. They also aided in drawing out key features to be added in the redesign.
                The below is an example task flow for choosing a fantasy book to read.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container">
                    <img src="images/userflow.jpg" alt="Userflow Sketch">

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">UI Design</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Homepage</h2>
            <p>
                On the homepage, there are changes made to the interaction with posts on the user's timeline. Previously, the "like" and "comment" buttons were links instead of buttons.
                Removing the comment link prevents redundancy since a comment bar currently exists in conjunction with the link below the post. The like button has become a heart in order to blend
                with existing UX design knowledge so that commonly found idioms across the majority of popular website designs are acknowledged for easier user experience. The idioms rely on commonly understood icons such as the heart.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container">                
                    <img src="images/homepage.png" alt="Homepage Screenshot">
                </div>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Friend's Page</h2>
            <p>
                    On the friend's page, there is a more visible "message" button so that it is clearer for users where they are able to message someone directly from their profile.
                    Additionally, a "favorite books" section has been added under the first section of the profile to showcase each user's preferences, making it easier for others to connect by
                    similar interests. A more obvious screen is also presented to users when unfriending someone to prevent change blindness.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container">
                    <img src="friended.png" alt="Friend">
                </div>
                <div class="i-container"> 
                    <img src="images/removefriend.png" alt="Friend Removed">
                </div>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Genre Search</h2>
            <p>
                When searching for a book within a specific genre, there is now a dedicated link to do so under the main section of the "Browse" dropdown menu. Within the page 
                itself, the text is larger in order to aid users in browsing for genres. By doing so, users are able to see the options for searching for books more easily.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container"> 
                    <img src="images/browsetab.png" alt="Browse Tab">
                </div>
                <div class="i-container"> 
                    <img src="images/genrepage.png" alt="Genre Page">
                </div>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Inbox</h2>
            <p>
                The inbox has been updated to contain larger text so that it is easier to see where users can compose messages from and what folder users are currently in.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container"> 
                    <img src="images/inbox.png" alt="Inbox">            
                </div>
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Inbox</h2>
            <p>
                The list search page has also been updated with larger text as well as a search bar under the main section of this page for consistency across the site since, similar
                to the search bar in the genre search page. The specific list pages now contain a "like this list" button to  make it easier for users to see where they can like a list as a specific "liked list" category
                already exists for users without a clear action.
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="i-container"> 
                    <img src="images/listpage.png" alt="List Page">            
                </div>
                <div class="i-container"> 
                    <img src="images/examplelist.png" alt="Example List Page">

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Prototype and Testing</h2>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                To access the prototype on Figma:
                <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/Jtn0Mnx6m7gchMzRc43ajR/Goodreads-Redesign?node-id=0-1&t=4PIHMdAGi1VSbh28-1">Full prototype here.</a>
                <br>
                <br>         
            </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>
                The first prototype was tested with three users with thinkaloud sessions. The following is a summary of the results as well as changes implemented in the final:
                <br>
                <br>
                <a style="font-weight: 700;">2/3</a> of users were able to complete the tasks provided to them without assistance.
                <br>
                Confusion regarding the lists page resulted in a "list search bar" being added due to difficulty in locating the search bar on the side amidst several other links.
                <br>
                <br>
                <a style="font-weight: 700;">100%</a> of users understood the goal of the site.
                <br>
                <br>
                All users had difficulty searching for users to add as a friend through existing means, resulting in a "search for useres" added to the search bar at the top of the screen.

            <p>
                This project taught me that there are many nuances to take into consideration during the design iteration and research process in UX design. When I initially started, my group and I had
                a few clear aspects of the site that we wanted to alter in the redesign. However, with more and more research and user testing, we realized that ever person's interaction with a given site is unique,
                resulting in certain pitfalls in changing the design and more brainstorming to adjust the prototype to make the site navigation a seamless process for the intended audience.
